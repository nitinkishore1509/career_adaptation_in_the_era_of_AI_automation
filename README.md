# Career Adaptation in the Era of AI & Automation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates **synthetic workforce data** to analyze whether individuals in different industries should **upgrade their skills in AI** to remain competitive in the job market.  
It uses simulated demographic and professional attributes to assess **skill adaptation needs** based on **age, experience, tenure, domain, and AI adoption trends**.

The notebook demonstrates:
- Synthetic dataset creation
- Statistical feature generation
- Exploratory analysis
- Decision-making logic for AI skill upgrading

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Simulate** realistic industry workforce data.
- **Analyze** workforce adaptation needs in the era of AI automation.
- **Identify** factors influencing skill upgrade requirements.
- Provide a **framework** for career planning and workforce reskilling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Random data generation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization (if present)
- **Random** – Probability-based simulations

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is **synthetically generated** within the notebook and includes:
- `Age`  
- `Gender`  
- `Experience (Years)`  
- `Industry Domain`  
- `Current Position Tenure`  
- `Interest in Job Change`  
- `AI Adoption in Domain`  
- `Skill Upgrade Requirement`

---

📊 Sample Insights
Age and tenure significantly influence AI skill upgrade recommendations.

High AI adoption domains require faster adaptation.

Professionals with longer tenure in static domains are less likely to need urgent AI upskilling compared to those in high-disruption industries.
